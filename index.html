You’ve written what You want from me in stone<br>

A refection of Your character alone<br>

So I try to keep Your laws without regret<br>

But I’m easily distracted and forget<br><br>
So write them on my heart<br>

Seal them in my mind<br>

The beauty of Your law and grace combined<br>

Remind me just how lovely Your commandments are<br>

And write them on the tablet of my heart<br><br>

There ‘s only one desire inside of me<br>

It’s to be everything You created me to be<br>

And I know the only way that I can grow<br>

It’s for You to come inside and take control<br><br>

So write them on my heart<br>

Seal them in my mind<br>

The beauty of Your law and grace combined<br>

Remind me just how lovely Your commandments are<br>

And write them on the tablets of my heart<br><br>

Your law reflects Your goodness<br>

The cross reveals Your grace<br>

Love is the motivation behind your perfect ways<br><br>

So write them on my heart<br>

Seal them in my mind<br>

The beauty of Your law and grace combined<br>

Remind me just how lovely Your commandments are<br>

And write them on the tablets of my heart<br><br>

So write them on my heart<br>

Engrave them in my mind<br>

The beauty of Your law and grace combined<br>

Remind me just how lovely Your commandments are<br>

And write them on the tablets of my heart<br><br>

Remind me just how lovely Your commandments are<br>

And write them on the tablets of my heart..</p>
